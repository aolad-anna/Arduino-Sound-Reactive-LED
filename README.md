| PPROJECT TITLE: Arduino Sound Reactive LED |
| PROJECT OUTLINE: : (1). **Methodology:**  **In this project there is an Arduino port which has built in components like transistors, diode, inductor, pushbutton, capacitor and so on. When any sort of sound with a frequency level is detected by the port which is connected with the program code uploaded. As it senses the sound and the LED lights turns on according to the frequency high level as voltage up, LED ON and low level or voltage down , LED OFF. The code will be done by a simple if else statement in program. The LED lights will be neither OFF nor BLINKING at all while no sound is detected. As, the sound with a frequency is detected, the system LED turns ON or starts BLINKING again.** (2). **Components Required** WIRE RESISTOR TRANSISTOR BREADBOARD CAPACITOR (both pnp and npn) POWER SUPPLY LED PHOTORESISTOR INDUCTOR PUSHBUTTON DIODE RELAY |
